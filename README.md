This site provides a mashup of user specified topics.

The user can use the form input and buttons to add either movie or GIF topic buttons.  
When the user clicks the button, a set of cards is displayed on the page with appropriate content.  
The user can choose to overwrite the existing results with the next set of results by clicking the "Overwrite" checkbox.  If overwrite is not chosen, the existing set of results is appended.
The user can remove unwanted buttons by checking the "Delete Buttons" checkbox and clicking on the buttons to delete.

GIF buttons and results have a blue background.
Movie buttons and results have a yellow background.

The user can click on a GIF still image to play it.  Clicking on the animated GIF will turn it back into a still image.
